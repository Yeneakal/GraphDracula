# GraphDracula
Implementation of an approximation algorithm that solves the TSP problem in Java.

***What it does***
- generate a full weighted graph with a random coordinate for each vertex.
- compute a minimum spanning tree (MST).
- do a depth-first-search (DFS) on the previously generated MST. Doing this will deliver a solution to the TSP-Problem implicitly

***Example***
